antipattern_type: Cyclic Hierarchy
definition: This anti-pattern refers to the mistake of directly referencing a subtype from a supertype. Therefore, it implies that there are circular dependencies between the namespaces containing subtype and supertype.

    refactor_method: |
      "The refactoring strategies employed include the use of visitor patterns, delegation, and careful management of class dependencies to avoid cyclic relationships. Specifically, the introduction of a Schema.Visitor interface helps decouple schema traversal from specific schema implementations, reducing coupling between classes."
    detail_refactor_operation: |
      "1. Introduction of the Schema.Visitor interface: This allows for polymorphic traversal of schemas without needing explicit type checks or casts, thus reducing coupling and potential cyclic dependencies. 2. Delegation: By delegating schema traversal logic to separate visitor objects, the original schema classes can focus on their primary responsibilities, simplifying their structure and interactions. 3. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) application: High-level modules (in this case, schema traversal logic) are decoupled from low-level modules (specific schema implementations), with both depending on abstractions (the Schema.Visitor interface). This inversion helps mitigate the risk of cyclic dependencies by making module interactions more predictable and easier to manage."
